## NOTES AND STEPS TO BUILDING THIS PROJECT
The codebase for each step can be found in the commit link


## PROJECT SETUP

### 1. Create project using create-react-app
- Run in the command line:
  - `npx create-react-app revents --use-npm`
  - The `--use-npm` flag is to ensure that we're using the npm package manager
- Once the React app is successfully created, cd into the project directory: `cd revents`
- Then run: `npm start`. This starts up the development server
- Can view the revents application in the browser: `http://localhost:3000`

### 2. Add hot module replacement
- The hot module replacement prevents a full page reload when we make changes to our code. It incrementally updates the page as we update our code. This is a common thing to do
- In index.js file:
  ```js
  const rootEl = document.getElementById('root');

  function render() {
    ReactDOM.render(<App />, rootEl);
  }

  // If we make changes to our App component and module.hot is available,
  // update the page with the App component without doing a full page reload
  if (module.hot) {
    module.hot.accept('./App', function () {
      setTimeout(render);
    });
  }

  render();
  ```

### 3. Add folder structure to our project
- We want to add a little folder structure and rearrange files of our project and also clean up any files from create-react-app that we don't 
  - All the features we will build in this project will go inside the 'features' folder
  - All the common features and components that will be used across the application will go inside the 'app' folder

## REACT CONCEPTS
- Components
- Virtual DOM
- One way binding
- JSX

**Components**
- Traditional web page: HTML, JS, CSS
- React: components which made up of JS, HTML, CSS

**React uses a Virtual DOM**
- React -> Virtual DOM -> Actual DOM
- Any updates we make are going to be stored inside a virtual representation of Document Object Model, and only those changes are going to be applied to the actual DOM
- This makes React pretty fast

**What is a Virtual DOM**
- Tree of JS Objects that represent the actual DOM itself
- We write the code as if we are recreating the entire DOM on every update and we rely on React to make the changes on our behalf
- Developer returns the DOM they wish to see
- React takes care of the transformation behind the scenes

**One way binding**
- Other libraries use 2 way bindings
  - Model updated in the DOM updates the component
- React bindings only go from component to Virtual DOM which updates the actual DOM
- This makes the code predictable and easy to debug

**Performance**
- The Virtual DOM:
  - Efficient diffing algorithms. React is going to take care of deciding what's necessary to update in the DOM
  - Update subtrees, the different parts of the DOM simultaneously 
  - Batch updates to the DOM
- Result = easy to use and optimized way to build web apps

**JSX**
- When we're writing code of React, what we're effectively doing is just creating Javascript functions that return JSX
- JSX adds an XML Syntax to Javascript, which makes React more elegant
- JSX tags have a tag name, attributes and children. Whilst it looks very similar to HTML, there are a few slight differences
- Note that we're not allowed to use the word 'class' inside JSX because the word 'class' is a reserved word in Javascript. Instead we use className to style our component
