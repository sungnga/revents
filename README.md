## NOTES AND STEPS TO BUILDING THIS PROJECT
The codebase for each step can be found in the commit link


## PROJECT SETUP

### [1. Create project using create-react-app]()
- Run in the command line:
  - `npx create-react-app revents --use-npm`
  - The `--use-npm` flag is to ensure that we're using the npm package manager
- Once the React app is successfully created, cd into the project directory: `cd revents`
- Then run: `npm start`. This starts up the development server
- Can view the revents application in the browser: `http://localhost:3000`

### [2. Add hot module replacement]()
- The hot module replacement prevents a full page reload when we make changes to our code. It incrementally updates the page as we update our code. This is a common thing to do
- In index.js file:
  ```js
  const rootEl = document.getElementById('root');

  function render() {
    ReactDOM.render(<App />, rootEl);
  }

  // If we make changes to our App component and module.hot is available,
  // update the page with the App component without doing a full page reload
  if (module.hot) {
    module.hot.accept('./App', function () {
      setTimeout(render);
    });
  }

  render();
  ```

### [3. Add folder structure to our project]()
- We want to add a little folder structure and rearrange files of our project and also clean up any files from create-react-app that we don't 
  - All the features we will build in this project will go inside the 'features' folder
  - All the common features and components that will be used across the application will go inside the 'app' folder

### [4. Install Semantic UI CSS + Semantic UI React libraries]()
- Docs: www.react.semantic-ui.com
- Install Semantic UI React and Semantic UI CSS libraries
  - Run to install both: `npm i semantic-ui-react semantic-ui-css`
- In index.js file:
  - Import the semantic min css just above the styles.css file: `import 'semantic-ui-css/semantic.min.css';`
- When using Semantic UI React library, we can import style components inside our components to add styles to our JSX. We add component attributes to specify the style we want from that style component. An example is in App.jsx file


## EVENT DASHBOARD PAGE LAYOUTS

### [1. Create a basic EventDashboard component]()
- This component renders two columns: a 10-column grid and a 6-column grid using Semantic Grid component
- In src/features/events/eventDashboard folder, create a component called EventDashboard.jsx
- NOTE: the file extension for a React component is `.jsx` instead of plain `.js` to denote that it contains JSX in it
- In EventDashboard.jsx file:
  - Import React: `import React from 'react';`
  - Import semantic Grid component: `import { Grid } from 'semantic-ui-react';`
  - Write an EventDashboard functional component
    - Render the Semantic UI Grid in JSX for now
    - Semantic UI uses a 16-column grid system
    ```javascript
    // Semantic UI uses a 16-col grid system
    export default function EventDashboard() {
      return (
        <Grid>
          <Grid.Column width={10}>
            <h2>Left Column</h2>
          </Grid.Column>
          <Grid.Column width={6}>
            <h2>Right Column</h2>
          </Grid.Column>
        </Grid>
      );
    }
    ```
- In src/app/layout folder, create a component called App.jsx
- In App.jsx file:
  - Import React: `import React from 'react';`
  - Import the EventDashboard component: `import EventDashboard from '../../features/events/eventDashboard/EventDashboard';`
  - Write an App functional component that renders other components to the page
  - Render the EventDashboard component inside JSX
  ```javascript
  export default function App() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Re-vents</h1>
        <EventDashboard />
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```

### [2. Create a NavBar component, add styling]()
- All the assets (logo, images, etc.) we will use in this project can be found in public/assets folder
- Create a NavBar menu and add styles to it
- In features/nav folder, create a component called NavBar.jsx
- In NavBar.jsx file:
  - Import React: `import React from 'react';`
  - Import Semantic Button, Container, and Menu components: `import { Button, Container, Menu } from 'semantic-ui-react';`
  - Write a NavBar functional component that renders the navigation menu using Semantic UI components
  ```javascript
  import React from 'react';
  import { Button, Container, Menu } from 'semantic-ui-react';

  export default function NavBar() {
    return (
      <Menu inverted fixed='top'>
        <Container>
          <Menu.Item header>
            <img src='/assets/logo.png' alt='logo' style={{ marginRight: 15 }} />
          </Menu.Item>
          <Menu.Item name='Events' />
          <Menu.Item>
            <Button positive inverted content='Create Event' />
          </Menu.Item>
          <Menu.Item position='right'>
            <Button basic inverted content='Login' />
            <Button
              basic
              inverted
              content='Register'
              style={{ marginLeft: '0.5em' }}
            />
          </Menu.Item>
        </Container>
      </Menu>
    );
  }
  ```
- In App.jsx file:
  - Import the NavBar component: `import NavBar from '../../features/nav/NavBar';`
  - Import Semantic Container: `import { Container } from 'semantic-ui-react';` 
  - Render the NavBar component just above the EventDashboard component. Also wrap the EventDashboard component in a container so we can apply styles to it
  ```javascript
  import EventDashboard from '../../features/events/eventDashboard/EventDashboard';
  import NavBar from '../../features/nav/NavBar';
  import { Container } from 'semantic-ui-react';

  export default function App() {
    return (
      <>
        <NavBar />
        <Container className='main'>
          <EventDashboard />
        </Container>
      </>
    );
  }
  ```
- In src/app/layout folder, create a file called styles.css. This page will contain the project's css styles
- In styles.css file:
  - Apply background color styles to the NavBar menu
  - Apply styles for the main container so that there's a space between the navbar and the main content
  ```css
  body {
    background-color: #eaeaea;
  }

  .ui.fixed.menu {
    background-image: linear-gradient(
      135deg,
      rgb(24, 42, 115) 0%,
      rgb(33, 138, 174) 69%,
      rgb(32, 167, 172) 89%
    );
  }

  .ui.main.container {
    margin-top: 7em;
  }
  ```

### [3. Create event list items: EventList, EventListItem, and EventListAttendee components]()
- In the EventDashboard 10-column grid section, create and display the EventList component. The EventList component renders the EventListItem components. Each EventListItem component renders the title of the event, who is hosting the event, date, venue, description of the event, a button to view the event detail, and list of attendees (the EventListAttendee component)
- In features/events/eventDashboard folder, create a component called EventList.jsx
- In EventList.jsx file:
  - Import React: `import React from 'react';`
  - Import the EventListItem component: `import EventListItem from './EventListItem';`
  - Write an EventList functional component that renders the EventListItem component several times
  ```javascript
  export default function EventList() {
    return (
      <>
        <EventListItem />
        <EventListItem />
        <EventListItem />
        <EventListItem />
      </>
    );
  }
  ```
- In features/events/eventDashboard folder, create a component called EventListItem.jsx
- In EventListItem.jsx file:
  - Import React: `import React from 'react';`
  - Import Semantic components: `import { Button, Icon, Item, List, Segment } from 'semantic-ui-react';`
  - Import the EventListAttendee component: `import EventListAttendee from './EventListAttendee';`
  - Write an EventListItem functional component that renders the list item details using Semantic UI
    - Render several EventListAttendee components
  ```javascript
  export default function EventListItem() {
    return (
      <Segment.Group>
        <Segment>
          <Item.Group>
            <Item>
              <Item.Image size='tiny' circular src='/assets/user.png' />
              <Item.Content>
                <Item.Header content='Event Title' />
                <Item.Description>Hosted by Bob</Item.Description>
              </Item.Content>
            </Item>
          </Item.Group>
        </Segment>

        <Segment>
          <span>
            <Icon name='clock' /> Date
            <Icon name='marker' />
            Venue
          </span>
        </Segment>

        <Segment secondary>
          <List horizontal>
            <EventListAttendee />
            <EventListAttendee />
            <EventListAttendee />
          </List>
        </Segment>

        <Segment clearing>
          <div>Description of event</div>
          <Button color='teal' floated='right' content='View' />
        </Segment>
      </Segment.Group>
    );
  }
  ```
- In features/events/eventDashboard folder, create a component called EventListAttendee.jsx
- In EventListAttendee.jsx file:
  - Import React: `import React from 'react';`
  - Import Semantic Image and List components: `import { Image, List } from 'semantic-ui-react';`
  - Write an EventListAttendee functional component that renders list items of users
  ```javascript
  export default function EventListAttendee() {
    return (
      <List.Item>
        <Image size='mini' circular src='/assets/user.png' />
      </List.Item>
    );
  }
  ```
- In the EventDashboard.jsx file:
  - Import the EventList component: `import EventList from './EventList';`
  - Render the EventList component inside the 10-column Grid component
  ```javascript
  <Grid.Column width={10}>
    <EventList />
  </Grid.Column>
  ```

### [4. Create an event form: EventForm component]()
- In features/events/eventForm folder, create a component called EventForm.jsx
- In EventForm.jsx file:
  - Import React: `import React from 'react';`
  - Import Semantic components: `import { Button, Form, Header, Segment } from 'semantic-ui-react';`
  - Write an EventForm functional component that renders a form using Semantic UI to create an event
    ```javascript
    export default function EventForm() {
      return (
        <Segment clearing>
          <Header content='Create new event' />
          <Form>
            <Form.Field>
              <input type='text' placeholder='Event Title' />
            </Form.Field>
            <Form.Field>
              <input type='text' placeholder='Category' />
            </Form.Field>
            <Form.Field>
              <input type='text' placeholder='Description' />
            </Form.Field>
            <Form.Field>
              <input type='text' placeholder='City' />
            </Form.Field>
            <Form.Field>
              <input type='text' placeholder='Venue' />
            </Form.Field>
            <Form.Field>
              <input type='date' placeholder='Date' />
            </Form.Field>
            <Button type='submit' floated='right' positive content='Submit' />
            <Button type='submit' floated='right' content='Cancel' />
          </Form>
        </Segment>
      );
    }
    ```
- In EventDashboard.jsx file:
  - Import the EventForm component: `import EventForm from '../eventForm/EventForm';`
  - Render the component inside the 6-column Grid component
  ```javascript
  <Grid.Column width={6}>
    <EventForm />
  </Grid.Column>
  ```

### [5. Passing props down to child components]()
- In src/app/api folder, there's a sampleData.js file which contains sample data of events that we can use display events information
- In EventDashboard.jsx file:
  - Import the sample data file: `import { sampleData } from '../../../app/api/sampleData';`
  - The EventDashboard component is a parent of the EventList component. Parent can pass properties/props down to child components
  - Pass the events props to the EventList child component and assign its value to sampleData
    - `<EventList events={sampleData} />`
- In EventList.jsx file:
  - To receive properties/props being passed down from the parent component, simply take `props` as an argument
    - `export default function EventList(props) { ... }`
  - Now the EventList component has assess to the events sample data by using the `props.events` notation
  - We can further destructure the events object from props
    - `export default function EventList({ events }) { ... }`
  - Loop over the events array using the .map() method and pass down the event item, as event props, to the EventListItem component
  ```javascript
  export default function EventList({ events }) {
    return (
      <>
        {events.map((event) => (
          <EventListItem event={event} key={event.id} />
        ))}
      </>
    );
  }
  ```
- In EventListItem.jsx file:
  - Receive the event props as an argument from EventList parent component and destructure it
    - `export default function EventListItem({ event }) { ... }`
  - Now we can update the event generic detail information with the event properties, which have the sample data
  - To display the list of attendees, loop through the event.attendees array using the .map() method and pass down the attendee item, as attendee props, to the EventListAttendee child component
  ```javascript
  export default function EventListItem({ event }) {
    return (
      <Segment.Group>
        <Segment>
          <Item.Group>
            <Item>
              <Item.Image size='tiny' circular src={event.hostPhotoURL} />
              <Item.Content>
                <Item.Header content={event.title} />
                <Item.Description>Hosted by {event.hostedBy}</Item.Description>
              </Item.Content>
            </Item>
          </Item.Group>
        </Segment>

        <Segment>
          <span>
            <Icon name='clock' /> {event.date}
            <Icon name='marker' />
            {event.venue.address}
          </span>
        </Segment>

        <Segment secondary>
          <List horizontal>
            {event.attendees.map((attendee) => (
              <EventListAttendee attendee={attendee} key={attendee.id} />
            ))}
          </List>
        </Segment>

        <Segment clearing>
          <div>{event.description}</div>
          <Button color='teal' floated='right' content='View' />
        </Segment>
      </Segment.Group>
    );
  }
  ```
- In EventListAttendee.jsx file:
  - Receive the attendee props as an argument from EventListItem parent component and destructure it
    - `export default function EventListAttendee({ attendee }) { ... }`
  - Replace the image source with `attendee.photoURL`
  ```javascript
  export default function EventListAttendee({ attendee }) {
    return (
      <List.Item>
        <Image size='mini' circular src={attendee.photoURL} />
      </List.Item>
    );
  }
  ```

### [6. React component state: using React useState hook]()
- We can make use of React's useState hook to keep track of the state of component. For example, we want to keep track of the state whether the EventForm component is displayed or not. And we can toggle this state in various places within our application. We can use useState hook to keep track of the list of events (when we add or delete events)
- In EventDashboard.jsx file:
  - Import react useState hook: `import React, { useState } from 'react';`
  - Create an `events` state and initialize its value to sampleData. Now the `events` state holds the data sample coming from the dataSample.js file
    - `const [events, setEvents] = useState(sampleData);`
  - For the events props that we pass down to the EventList child component, we can assign its value to events state
    - `<EventList events={events} />`
- Now let's work on showing and hiding the EventForm based on the state. When the "Create Event" button in the NavBar is clicked, we want to display the EventForm. When the "Cancel" button in the EventForm is clicked, we want to hide the EventForm
- In App.jsx file:
  - Import react useState hook: `import React, { useState } from 'react';`
  - Create a formOpen state and initialize it to false
    - `const [formOpen, setFormOpen] = useState(false);`
  - Pass the setFormOpen method down as props to the NavBar child component. The NavBar component will consume this method, setting the state to true, when the 'Create Event' button is clicked. This will trigger the EventForm component to display in the EventDashboard component
    - `<NavBar setFormOpen={setFormOpen} />`
  - Pass the formOpen state and setFormOpen method down as props to the EventDashboard component
    - `<EventDashboard formOpen={formOpen} setFormOpen={setFormOpen} />` 
  ```javascript
  export default function App() {
    const [formOpen, setFormOpen] = useState(false);

    return (
      <>
        <NavBar setFormOpen={setFormOpen} />
        <Container className='main'>
          <EventDashboard formOpen={formOpen} setFormOpen={setFormOpen} />
        </Container>
      </>
    );
  }
  ```
- In the NavBar.jsx file:
  - Receive the setFormOpen props as an argument from App parent component and destructure it
    - `export default function NavBar({ setFormOpen }) { ... }`
  - In the 'Create Event' button element
    - Add an onClick event that will execute the setFormOpen method when the button is clicked
    - Execute the setFormOpen method inside an arrow/anonymous function and pass in true as an argument
    - We execute the setFormOpen method inside an arrow function because we want to call setFormOpen() only when the button is clicked. We don't want to execute setFormOpn() when the NavBar component loads
    - `<Button onClick={() => setFormOpen(true)} positive inverted content='Create Event' />`
- In EventDashboard.jsx file:
  - Receive the formOpen and setFormOpen props as an argument from App parent component and destructure them
    - `export default function EventDashboard({ formOpen, setFormOpen }) { ... }`
  - Pass the setFormOpen method down as props to the EventForm child component. The EventForm component will consume this method, setting the state to false, when the 'Cancel' button is clicked
  - We can show or hide the event form based on the state
    - `{formOpen && <EventForm setFormOpen={setFormOpen} />}`
    - Whatever is on the left of && is true, do whatever is on the right of &&
    - Only display the EventForm component if formOpen state is true
    - This means that when the when the 'Create Event' in the NavBar is clicked, formOpen state is true and EventForm will display
    - When the 'Cancel' button in the EventForm component is clicked, formOpen state is false and EventForm will not display
  ```javascript
  export default function EventDashboard({ formOpen, setFormOpen }) {
    const [events, setEvents] = useState(sampleData);

    return (
      <Grid>
        <Grid.Column width={10}>
          <EventList events={events} />
        </Grid.Column>
        <Grid.Column width={6}>
          {formOpen && <EventForm setFormOpen={setFormOpen} />}
        </Grid.Column>
      </Grid>
    );
  }
  ```
- In the EventForm.jsx file:
  - Receive the setFormOpen props as an argument from EventDashboard parent component and destructure it
    - `export default function EventForm({ setFormOpen }) { ... }`
  - In the 'Cancel' button element
    - Add an onClick event handler and execute the setFormOpen() method inside an arrow function and set it to false
    ```javascript
    <Button
      onClick={() => setFormOpen(false)}
      type='submit'
      floated='right'
      content='Cancel'
    />
    ```

## CRUD OPERATIONS IN REACT
- Uncontrolled Forms (legacy)
  - Use 'refs' to access the element
  - Give input a ref value
  - Access the field using ref.name.value
  - React has no awareness of the value
- Controlled Components
  - No direct access to the DOM
  - So no access to Input
  - Only concerned with altering State
  - Rely on React to manipulate the DOM via the Virtual DOM

### [1. Basic forms in React: EventForm]()
- Enable the EventForm component to receive input values from the user/EventForm and update the values state with the input values
- In EventDashboard.jsx file:
  - Since we're going to be updating events, we're going to be updating them in events state. So we want to pass down the setEvents method as props to the EventForm child component 
    - `<EventForm setFormOpen={setFormOpen} setEvents={setEvents} />`
- In EventForm.jsx file:
  - Receive the setEvents props as an argument from EventDashboard parent component and destructure it
    - `export default function EventForm({ setEvents }) { ... }`
  - Create an initialValues object with initial empty-value properties
    ```javascript
    const initialValues = {
      title: '',
      category: '',
      description: '',
      city: '',
      venue: '',
      date: ''
    };
    ```
  - Create a values state and initialize its value to the initialValues object. Note that this values state is an object
    - `const [values, setValues] = useState(initialValues);`
  - In the Form element, the handleFormSubmit method is executed when the onSubmit event is triggered. Meaning, when the Submit button is clicked
    - `<Form onSubmit={handleFormSubmit}>`
  - For each Form input element, the handleInputChange method is executed when the input value changes via the onChange event being triggered
    - add name, value, and onChange properties to each form input element
    ```javascript
    <Form.Field>
      <input
        type='text'
        placeholder='Event Title'
        name='title'
        value={values.title}
        onChange={(e) => handleInputChange(e)}
      />
    </Form.Field>
    ```
  - Write a handleInputChange method that updates the values state with the input values
    - It takes the input event as argument
    - Each input element has name and value properties, so we can destructure those from e.target
    - Update the values state with the input values based on its name and value properties
    ```javascript
    function handleInputChange(e) {
      const { name, value } = e.target;
      setValues({ ...values, [name]: value });
    }
    ```
  - Write a handleFormSubmit method that creates an event
    - Console log the values state for now
    ```javascript
    function handleFormSubmit() {
      console.log(values);
    }
    ```

### [2. Creating an event, cuid library]()
- We create a new event by updating the events state with the new event. Do this by creating a method and pass in the values state which comes from the form input values
- In EventDashboard.jsx file:
  - Write a handleCreateEvent method that adds a new event received to the events state using the setEvents() method
    - It takes event as an argument
    - Note that the events state is an array. So when we call the setEvents(), we add the new event to an array
    ```javascript
    function handleCreateEvent(event) {
      setEvents([...events, event]);
    }
    ```
  - Then pass down this handleCreateEvent method as createEvent props to the EventForm child component
    - `<EventForm createEvent={handleCreateEvent} />`
- In EventForm.jsx file:
  - Receive the createEvent props as an argument from EventDashboard parent component and destructure it
    - `export default function EventForm({ createEvent }) { ... }`
  - In the handleFormSubmit() method
    - Execute the createEvent method and pass in the values state as argument
    ```javascript
    function handleFormSubmit() {
      createEvent(values);
    }
    ```
- Now, when we hit form submit to create a new event, we will run into 2 errors
  - First is, we don't have a unique event id. In the EventList component, when we're mapping over the events array, it's expecting to find an event.id for each event
  - Second is, our values object state does not have an attendees property. Since the attendees array is not defined and the .map() method is called on it, we get an error
  - Solution: need to provide the event an id and an array of attendees
- Install a cuid package, a unique identifier: `npm install cuid`
- In EventForm.jsx file:
  - Import the cuid: `import cuid from 'cuid';`
  - In the handleFormSubmit() method:
    - What we provide to the createEvent() method is the existing `values` state object, plus an id property with the cuid value
      - Also add a hostedBy property. Set a default string value for now
      - Also add an attendees property. Set it to an empty array for now
      - Also add a hostPhotoURL property. Set it to a static image for now
    - Lastly, once the form has been submitted to create an event, we want to close the form. Do this by calling the setFormOpen() method and set it to false 
    ```javascript
    function handleFormSubmit() {
      createEvent({
        ...values,
        id: cuid(),
        hostedBy: 'Bob',
        attendees: [],
        hostPhotoURL: '/assets/user.png'
      });
      setFormOpen(false);
    }
    ```

### [3. Selecting an event to read]()
- When we click on the 'View' button on an event, it opens up the event form and populates the values from the event inside the form as well. We need to create a selectedEvent state to store the selected event values. And depending on the condition of this state, we can either show an empty form or a form with the values from the event
- In App.jsx file:
  - Create a selectedEvent state and give its initial value of null
    - `const [selectedEvents, setSelectedEvent] = useState(null);`
  - Write a handleSelectEvent method that sets the selectedEvent state to the event and opens the EventForm
    - It takes event as an argument
  - Write a handleCreateFormOpen method that sets the selectedEvent to null and opens the EventForm
    - It doesn't take any arguments
  - Pass down the handleCreateFormOpen method as setFormOpen props to the NavBar child component
  - For the EventDashboard child component, we pass down the handleSelectEvent method and the selectedEvent state as props
  ```javascript
  export default function App() {
    const [formOpen, setFormOpen] = useState(false);
    const [selectedEvent, setSelectedEvent] = useState(null);

    function handleSelectEvent(event) {
      setSelectedEvent(event);
      setFormOpen(true);
    }

    function handleCreateFormOpen() {
      setSelectedEvent(null);
      setFormOpen(true);
    }

    return (
      <>
        <NavBar setFormOpen={handleCreateFormOpen} />
        <Container className='main'>
          <EventDashboard
            formOpen={formOpen}
            setFormOpen={setFormOpen}
            selectEvent={handleSelectEvent}
            selectedEvent={selectedEvent}
          />
        </Container>
      </>
    );
  }
  ```
- In EventDashboard.jsx file:
  - Receive the selectEvent and selectedEvent props as an argument from App parent component and destructure them
    - `export default function EventDashboard({ selectEvent, selectedEvent }) {...}`
  - Pass down the selectEvent method as selectEvent props to the EventList child component
    - `<EventList events={events} selectEvent={selectEvent} />`
  - Pass down the selectedEvent state as selectedEvent props to the EventForm child component. This way we can see the selected form
    - `<EventForm selectedEvent={selectedEvent} />`
- In EventList.jsx file:
  - Receive the selectEvent props as an argument from EventDashboard parent component and destructure it
    - `export default function EventList({ events, selectEvent }) {...}`
  - Pass down this props as selectEvent props to the EventListItem child component
    - `<EventListItem event={event} key={event.id} selectEvent={selectEvent} />`
- In EventListItem.jsx file:
  - Receive the selectEvent props as an argument from EventList parent component and destructure it
    - `export default function EventListItem({ event, selectEvent }) {...}`
  - In the 'View' Button element:
    - Add an onClick event property that executes the selectEvent() method when the 'View' button is clicked
    - Call the selectEvent() method inside an arrow function and pass in the event as argument
    ```javascript
    <Button
      onClick={() => selectEvent(event)}
      color='teal'
      floated='right'
      content='View'
    />
    ```
- In EventForm.jsx file:
  - Receive the selectedEvent props as an argument from EventDashboard parent component and destructure it
    - `export default function EventForm({ selectedEvent }) {...}`
  - We're going to use the `?? null conditional operator` to check if the selectedEvent state is null
    - If selectedEvent state is null, then we pass anything to the right of ??. This means that the initialValues is set to the empty-string object
    - If selectedEvent state is NOT null, then the initialValues is set to the selectedEvent state values
    - Remember that when the 'View' button is clicked (in EventListItem component), the setSelectedEvent() method is called (in App.jsx component) to set the event values to the selectedEvent state
    ```javascript
    // ?? is the null conditional operator
    // The ?? means that if selectedEvent is null, the initialValues is set to whatever is on the right of the ??
    // If selectedEvent is NOT null, set the initialValues to the values of selectedEvent
    const initialValues = selectedEvent ?? {
      title: '',
      category: '',
      description: '',
      city: '',
      venue: '',
      date: ''
    };
    ```

### [4. Controlled components with a key: EventForm]()
- The current problem we have is that when we click on the 'View' button to view a different event or click on the 'Create Event' button to create a new event, nothing causes the page to re-render so nothing happens. Behind the scene, however, the EventForm component does have the correct information in props when one of those buttons are clicked
- When we send new props to a component, it does not cause the component to be re-rendered. The work-around solution is to use the special React attribute called `key`. We can add a `key` property to a component. So when the key changes, the component will be recreated with a freshly initialized state
- So we're going to give our EventForm component a key
- In EventDashboard.jsx file:
  - For the EventForm child component, add a key property
  - For the key value, we first check to see if we have a selected event in selectedEvent state, if selectedEvent is not null
    - If it's not null, set the key value to selectedEvent.id
    - If it's null, then set the key to be null itself
  - `<EventForm key={selectedEvent ? selectedEvent.id : null} />`
- Lastly, if the selected event form is opened, we want the form title to say 'Edit the event'. If it's a new event form, the form title should say 'Create new event'
- In EventForm.jsx file:
  - In the Header element, add a conditional to display one or the other
  - `<Header content={selectedEvent ? 'Edit the event' : 'Create new event'} />`

### [5. Updating an event]()
- We can update an event in the events state by check the updatedEvent id with the event id in the events state. If it matches, we can update the event with the new values. Write a method to handle the update event
- In EventDashboard.jsx file:
  - Write a handleUpdateEvent method that updates an event in the events state based on the event id. Also sets the selectedEvent back to null and closes the form
    - This method takes an updatedEvent as argument
    - Use the setEvents() method to set the events state with the updated event, if the updatedEvent id matches with the event id in the events state
    - Use the selectEvent() method to set the selectedEvent state back to null
    ```javascript
    function handleUpdateEvent(updatedEvent) {
      setEvents(
        events.map((evt) => (evt.id === updatedEvent.id ? updatedEvent : evt))
      );
      selectEvent(null);
    }
    ```
  - Pass down this handleUpdateEvent method as updateEvent props to the EventForm child component
    - `<EventForm updateEvent={handleUpdateEvent} />`
- In EventForm.jsx file:
  - Receive the updateEvent props as an argument from EventDashboard parent component and destructure it
    - `export default function EventForm({ updateEvent }) {...}`
  - In the handleFormSubmit() method:
    - Use a ternary operator to check if selectedEvent state is not null
    - If it's not null, call the updateEvent() method. What we give to the method is the all the current values in selectedEvent state, plus the updated values that's replacing the values in selectedEvent state. The spread operator of `selectedEvent` ensures that we keep the existing properties if its value isn't updated. And the spread operator of `values` will replace the existing values of properties that are updated
    - If it's null, then call the createEvent() method. If we're not updating an event, then we know that we're creating an event
    ```javascript
    function handleFormSubmit() {
      selectedEvent
        ? updateEvent({ ...selectedEvent, ...values })
        : createEvent({
            ...values,
            id: cuid(),
            hostedBy: 'Bob',
            attendees: [],
            hostPhotoURL: '/assets/user.png'
          });
      setFormOpen(false);
    }
    ```

### [6. Deleting an event]()
- In EventDashboard.jsx file:
  - Write a handleDeleteEvent method removes an event from the events state based on its id
    - This method takes an eventId as argument
    - Call the setEvents() method to update the events state
    - Use the .filter() method on events to filter out all the events that does not match the eventId, hence removes the event that matches
    ```javascript
    function handleDeleteEvent(eventId) {
      setEvents(events.filter((evt) => evt.id !== eventId));
    }
    ```
  - Pass down this handleDeleteEvent method as deleteEvent props to the EventList child component
    - `<EventList deleteEvent={handleDeleteEvent} />`
- In EventList.jsx file:
  - Receive the deleteEvent props as an argument from EventDashboard parent component and destructure it
    - `export default function EventList({ deleteEvent }) {...}`
  - Pass down this DeleteEvent method as deleteEvent props to the EventListItem child component
    - `<EventListItem deleteEvent={deleteEvent} />`
- In EventListItem.jsx file:
  - Receive the deleteEvent props as an argument from EventList parent component and destructure it
    - `export default function EventListItem({ deleteEvent }) {...}`  
  - In the render section
    - Create a 'Delete' Button element
    - In the Delete Button element, add an onClick event listener that executes the deleteEvent() method when the 'Delete' button is clicked
    - Call the deleteEvent() method inside an arrow function and pass in the event.id
    ```javascript
    <Button
      onClick={() => deleteEvent(event.id)}
      color='red'
      floated='right'
      content='Delete'
    />
    ```


## ROUTING IN REACT

### Intro to react-router
- Routing
  - SPAs (single page applications) need routers
  - We only have one page (index.html). We don't have the ability to change the page that the user is on
  - We need the facility to redirect users to component rather than to another html page. More complex applications need React Router
- React Router is broken into 3 packages:
  - react-router
  - react-router-dom
  - react-router-native (mobile version)
- React-router-dom and react-router-native re-export all of react-router. React-router contains all of the main functionality. So we only need to install react-router-dom and we get all of the react-router functionality
- The Router
  - `<BrowserRouter>` component
    - We surround our App component in the BrowserRouter component. This will give our App component a routing capability
    - It handles dynamic requests
  - `<HashRouter>`
    - Useful for static websites
  - Can only have a single child component
  - Surround our `<App />` component to work with this limitation
- History
  - The history object is part of the browser. Every browser has a history object
  - The way the routing system works is it uses a history object which:
    - Keeps track of the current location
    - Re-renders whenever that changes and displays whatever components we are routing to
  - The history object comes with a number of methods
    - What we typically do is use the push() method to push a new route into history and this will cause the component to re-render and display what it is we're routing to on the page
  
**Install react-router-dom**
  - Install: `npm i react-router-dom`

### [1. Adding HomePage and EventDetailedPage components]()
- In our Revents application, we will use react-router to direct users to these pages:
  - Home page
  - Event dashboard page
  - Event detailed page
  - Event form page
- In features folder, create a new folder called home. In home folder, create a component/file called HomePage.jsx
- In HomePage.jsx file:
  - Import React: `import React from 'react';`
  - Write a HomePage functional component that renders a 'Homepage' text for now
- In features/events folder, create a new folder called eventDetailed. In eventDetailed folder, create a component/file called EventDetailedPage.jsx
- In EventDetailedPage.jsx file:
  - Import React: `import React from 'react';`
  - Write a EventDetailedPage functional component that render a 'Event Detailed Page' text for now

### [2. Routing configuration]()
- Website: https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start
- In index.js file:
  - Import BrowserRouter component: `import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';`
  - Wrap the App component inside the BrowserRouter component
  - This will give our App component a routing capability
  ```javascript
  function render() {
    ReactDOM.render(
      <BrowserRouter>
        <App />
      </BrowserRouter>,
      rootEl
    );
  }
  ```
- So now our App component has routing capability. We can setup the routes inside there
- In App.jsx file:
  - Import the Route component: `import { Route } from 'react-router-dom';`
  - Create routes using the Route component for HomePage, EventDashboard, EventDetailedPage, and EventForm components. Each route has a unique path
  ```javascript
  <Container className='main'>
    <Route path='/' exact component={HomePage} />
    <Route path='/events' exact component={EventDashboard} />
    <Route path='/events/:id' exact component={EventDetailedPage} />
    <Route path='/createEvent' exact component={EventForm} />
  </Container>
  ```

### [3. Using NavLinks and Links]()
- `NavLink` and `Link` are two components provided by react-router-dom that we can use to redirect users to a different page
- `<NavLink>` is a special version of the `<Link>` that will add styling attribute to the rendered element when it matches the current URL. It adds an activeClass and applies styles to a link
- In NavBar.jsx file:
  - Import the NavLink component: `import { NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';`
  - For Semantic UI components, we can use an 'as' property and give its value the name of another component that we want the Semantic component to act as
  - In our case, we want the Semantic `<Menu.Item>` to act as a `<NavLink>` component. Then we can pass in properties that the `<NavLink>` is expecting, such as the 'to' property pathname and 'exact'
  - Note that we no longer use the onClick event for the 'Create Event' button to direct user to the EventForm. We can use the NavLink instead
  ```javascript
  <Menu.Item as={NavLink} exact to='/' header>
    <img src='/assets/logo.png' alt='logo' style={{ marginRight: 15 }} />
    Re-vents
  </Menu.Item>
  <Menu.Item as={NavLink} to='/events' name='Events' />
  <Menu.Item as={NavLink} to='/createEvent'>
    <Button positive inverted content='Create Event' />
  </Menu.Item>
  ```

### [4. Styling the HomePage]()
- We don't want the NavBar to show when we're on home page. We want something that takes up the entire screen and provide a button that takes us to the events page
- In HomePage.jsx file:
  - Add content and styles to the page using Semantic UI
  ```javascript
  export default function HomePage() {
    return (
      <Segment inverted textAlign='center' vertical className='masthead'>
        <Container>
          <Header as='h1' inverted>
            <Image
              size='massive'
              src='/assets/logo.png'
              style={{ marginBottom: 12 }}
            />
            Re-vents
          </Header>
          <Button size='huge' inverted>
            Get started
            <Icon name='right arrow' inverted />
          </Button>
        </Container>
      </Segment>
    );
  }
  ```
- In styles.css file:
  - Add styles to the home page
  ```css
  .masthead {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    background-image: linear-gradient(
      135deg,
      rgb(24, 42, 115) 0%,
      rgb(33, 138, 174) 69%,
      rgb(32, 167, 172) 89%
    ) !important;
    height: 100vh;
  }

  .masthead h1.ui.header {
    font-size: 4em;
  }
  ```
- In App.jsx file:
  - For the HomePage to appear outside of the NavBar and Container components, we need create another route that renders the NavBar and Container separately from the HomePage
  - This new route takes a path with an expression that says, anything after the / forward slash plus something else, render it differently
  - This new route also takes a render property rather an a component property. This render property takes a function. And inside this function, we can render the NavBar and the Container components. Wrap it inside a fragment tag because it only allows one child component
  ```javascript
	return (
		<>
			<Route path='/' exact component={HomePage} />
			<Route
				path={'/(.+)'}
				render={() => (
					<>
						<NavBar setFormOpen={handleCreateFormOpen} />
						<Container className='main'>
							<Route path='/' exact component={HomePage} />
							<Route path='/events' exact component={EventDashboard} />
							<Route path='/events/:id' exact component={EventDetailedPage} />
							<Route path='/createEvent' exact component={EventForm} />
						</Container>
					</>
				)}
			/>
		</>
	);
  ```
- Since the HomePage component is inside a `<Route />` component, we have access to the routing properties. This is props being passed down to the HomePage component. One of these props is the history object. We can use the history.push() method to push another route onto the history object and push the user to that particular route
- In HomePage.jsx file:
  - Receive the history object props as an argument and destructure it
    - `export default function HomePage({ history }) {...}`
  - In the 'Get started' Button element:
    - Add an onClick event handler and execute the `history.push()` method to direct user to a different route when the button is clicked
    - Call the history.push() method inside an arrow function and pass in the pathname as the argument
    ```javascript
    <Button onClick={() => history.push('/events')} size='huge' inverted>
      Get started
      <Icon name='right arrow' inverted />
    </Button>
    ```

### [5. Adding menus for authenticated and unauthenticated users]()
- We're not going to implement any user authentication at this point. We're just going to give the user the ability to fake a login or not login for now
- In features/nav folder, create components/files called SignedInMenu.jsx and SignedOutMenu.jsx
- In SignedOutMenu.jsx file:
  - Import React: `import React from 'react';`
  - Import Semantic components: `import { Button, Menu } from 'semantic-ui-react';`
  - Write a SignedOutMenu functional component that renders the 'Login' and 'Register' buttons
    - Cut and paste the 'Login' and 'Register' Button elements from NavBar.jsx file
    ```javascript
    export default function SignedOutMenu() {
      return (
        <Menu.Item position='right'>
          <Button basic inverted content='Login' />
          <Button
            basic
            inverted
            content='Register'
            style={{ marginLeft: '0.5em' }}
          />
        </Menu.Item>
      );
    }
    ```
- In SignedInMenu.jsx file:
  - Import React: `import React from 'react';`
  - Import Link component: `import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';`
  - Import Semantic components: `import { Dropdown, Image, Menu } from 'semantic-ui-react';`
  - Write a SignedInMenu functional component that renders a user already signed in dropdown menu. Usee Semantic UI
    ```javascript
    export default function SignedInMenu() {
      return (
        <Menu.Item position='right'>
          <Image avatar spaced='right' src="/assets/user.png" />
          <Dropdown pointing='top left' text='Bob'>
            <Dropdown.Menu>
              <Dropdown.Item as={Link} to='/createEvent' text='Create Event' icon='plus' />
              <Dropdown.Item text='My profile' icon='user' />
              <Dropdown.Item text='Sign out' icon='power' />
            </Dropdown.Menu>
          </Dropdown>
        </Menu.Item>
      );
    }
    ```
- In NavBar.jsx file:
  - Import the SignedOutMenu component: `import SignedOutMenu from './SignedOutMenu';`
  - Import the SignedInMenu component: `import SignedInMenu from './SignedInMenu';`
  - Call the SignedOutMenu component in the render section: `<SignedOutMenu />`
  - Call the SignedInMenu component in the render section: `<SignedInMenu />`

### [6. Adding fake authentication]()
- For now, we'll use local states in our NavBar component to check if a user is authenticated or not. If the user is authenticated, they get to see the 'Create Event' button and the SignedInMenu appears. If not authenticated, they won't see the 'Create Event' button and the SignedOutMenu appears
- In NavBar.jsx file:
  - Create an authenticated state and set it to false as its initial value state
    - `const [authenticated, setAuthenticated] = useState(false);`
  - In the render section:
    - Write a ternary operator to check if a user is authenticated
      - If authenticated, show the `<SignedInMenu />` component
      - If not authenticated, show the `<SignedOutMenu />` component
      - `{authenticated ? <SignedInMenu /> : <SignedOutMenu />}`
    - Use the && operator to show the 'Create Event' Button/Link only if the user is authenticated
      ```javascript
      {authenticated && (
        <Menu.Item as={NavLink} to='/createEvent'>
          <Button positive inverted content='Create Event' />
        </Menu.Item>
      )}
      ```
  - Pass down the setAuthenticated method as setAuthenticated props to both SignedInMenu and SignedOutMenu components
    - `<SignedInMenu setAuthenticated={setAuthenticated} />`
    - `<SignedOutMenu setAuthenticated={setAuthenticated} />`
- In the SignedOutMenu.jsx file:
  - Receive the setAuthenticated props from the NavBar parent component and destructure it
  - In the 'Login' Button element:
    - Add an onClick event property and execute the setAuthenticated() method and set it to true
    - When the 'Login' button is clicked, the 'Create Event' button appears on the NavBar and switch to the SignedInMenu
    - `<Button onClick={() => setAuthenticated(true)} />`
- In the SignedInMenu.jsx file:
  - Receive the setAuthenticated props from the NavBar parent component and destructure it
  - In the 'Sign out' Dropdown.Item:
    - Add an onClick event property and execute the setAuthenticated() method and set it to false
    - So when the 'Sign out' dropdown is clicked, the 'Create Event' button will not show on the NavBar and switch to the SignedOutMenu
    - `<Dropdown.Item onClick={() => setAuthenticated(false)} text='Sign out' icon='power' />`

### [7. Using the useHistory hook]()
- Since the NavBar component is not in a Route component, it doesn't have access to the browser's history object. So we can't use the history.push() method to push the user to a new route. React-router comes with a useHistory hook that we can utilize instead
- When the authenticated user clicks the 'Sign out' button, it'll direct them to the homepage
- In NavBar.jsx file:
  - Import useHistory hook: `import { useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';`
  - Create a new `history` object by using the useHistory() hook
    - `const history = useHistory();`
  - And now we have access to the browser's `history` object, just like a routed component does
  - Write a handleSignOut method that logs out the user
    - This method sets the authenticated state to false using the setAuthenticated() method
    - And push the user to home page using the history.push() method
    ```javascript
    function handleSignOut() {
      setAuthenticated(false);
      history.push('/');
    }
    ```
  - Pass down this handleSignOut method as signOut props to the SignedInMenu child component
    - `<SignedInMenu signOut={handleSignOut} />`
- In SignedInMenu.jsx file:
  - Receive the signOut method props from the NavBar parent component and destructure it
  - In the 'Sign out' DropDown.Item, call the signOut method on the onClick event handler. We don't need to use the setAuthenticated() method anymore
  - `<Dropdown.Item onClick={signOut} text='Sign out' icon='power' />`

### [8. EventDetailedPage structure: creating smaller components]()
- The Event Detailed Page is significant and will have many features and functionalities. We'll break these into smaller components and render them onto the EventDetailedPage component
- In the features/events/eventDetailed folder, create the following components/files:
  - EventDetailedHeader.jsx
  - EventDetailedInfo.jsx
  - EventDetailedChat.jsx
  - EventDetailedSidebar.jsx
- Write a simple functional component for each of the above and render a simple title text
- In EventDetailedPage.jsx file:
  - Import Semantic Grid component: `import { Grid } from 'semantic-ui-react';`
  - Create the page layout using the Semantic UI Grid and place in the above components
  ```javascript
  export default function EventDetailedPage() {
    return (
      <Grid>
        <Grid.Column width={10}>
          <EventDetailedHeader />
          <EventDetailedInfo />
          <EventDetailedChat />
        </Grid.Column>

        <Grid.Column width={6}>
          <EventDetailedSidebar />
        </Grid.Column>
      </Grid>
    );
  }
  ```
- Now in the EventListItem component, when a user clicks on the 'View' event button, we can direct them to the EventDetailedPage of that event using the Link component
- In EventListItem.jsx file:
  - Import the Link component: `import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';`
  - Use the 'as' property to make the Button element act as a Link component
  - Use the 'to' property to set the pathname of the link
  ```javascript
  <Button
    as={Link}
    to={`/events/${event.id}`}
    color='teal'
    floated='right'
    content='View'
  />
  ```

### [9. Adding EventDetailedPage content]()
- Add content and styles to the following components:
  - EventDetailedHeader.jsx
  - EventDetailedInfo.jsx
  - EventDetailedChat.jsx
  - EventDetailedSidebar.jsx

### [10. Cleaning up the unused code]()
- Cleaning up our code up to this point
- Add a Link component to the 'Manage Event' button in EventDetailedHeader.jsx component, redirecting to manage event page
- Add a Link component to the 'Cancel' button in EventForm.jsx component, redirecting to events page
- We won't have the Create Event form on the right-hand column of the EventDashboard page anymore. When we click on the 'View' button of an event in the events page, it redirect to the EventDetailedPage instead

## REACT CONCEPTS
- Components
- Virtual DOM
- One way binding
- JSX

**Components**
- Traditional web page: HTML, JS, and CSS files
- React: components which made up of JS, HTML, and CSS. Multiple components make up a web page

**React uses a Virtual DOM**
- React -> Virtual DOM -> Actual DOM
- Any updates we make are going to be stored inside a virtual representation of Document Object Model, and only those changes are going to be applied to the actual DOM
- This makes React pretty fast

**What is a Virtual DOM**
- Tree of JS Objects that represent the actual DOM itself
- We write the code as if we are recreating the entire DOM on every update and we rely on React to make the changes on our behalf
- Developer returns the DOM they wish to see
- React takes care of the transformation behind the scenes

**One way binding**
- Other libraries use 2 way bindings
  - Model updated in the DOM updates the component
- React bindings only go from component to Virtual DOM which updates the actual DOM
- This makes the code predictable and easy to debug

**Performance**
- The Virtual DOM:
  - Efficient diffing algorithms. React is going to take care of deciding what's necessary to update in the DOM
  - Update subtrees, the different parts of the DOM simultaneously 
  - Batch updates to the DOM
- Result = easy to use and optimized way to build web apps

**JSX**
- When we're writing code of React, what we're effectively doing is just creating Javascript functions that return JSX
- JSX adds an XML Syntax to Javascript, which makes React more elegant
- JSX tags have a tag name, attributes and children. Whilst it looks very similar to HTML, there are a few slight differences
- Note that we're not allowed to use the word 'class' inside JSX because the word 'class' is a reserved word in Javascript. Instead we use className to style our component
